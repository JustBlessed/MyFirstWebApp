            <h2 class="section-title">Who is JESUS?</h2>
            <p>JESUS is not a character from a book. <b>JESUS is real and alive today.</b> JESUS is the <mark>son of GOD,</mark> the Word of GOD made flesh and the perfect example of a sacrificial life. JESUS was born by a virgin girl in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago, lived just like you and me on this earth and died to reconcile us all back to GOD.</p>
