    <h3 style="color: red">Who is JESUS?</h3>
    <P>JESUS is not a character from a book. <b>JESUS is real and alive today.</b> JESUS is the <mark>son of GOD,</mark> the Word of GOD made flesh and the perfect example of a sacrifial life. JESUS was born by a virgin girl in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago, lived just like you and me on this earth and died to reconcile us all back to GOD.</P>
    <h3 style="color: red">Benefits Of Having JESUS In Your Life</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Peace</li>
        <li>Unending joy</li>
        <li>Freedom from the power of darkness</li>


    </ul>
    <P>Now that you know a little about JESUS, i would like you to invite HIM into your heart. You can invite HIM to be the LORD of your life by saying this simple prayer.</P>
    <h4 style="color: blue">Prayer of Salvation</h4>
    <p style="color: blue">
    Dear LORD JESUS, i believe that YOU are the son of GOD and that YOU came to this world to die for my sins. I recieve YOU into my heart as my LORD and KING. Please guide me on this journey called life and help me to be with YOU in the end in JESUS Name, Amen.
